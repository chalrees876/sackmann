          <p>
            This web app was built as a personal data science and software engineering project.
            It uses match statistics from professional tennis players to train a
            <strong>logistic regression model</strong> that predicts match outcomes
            based on serving performance metrics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application is built with <strong>Django</strong> on the backend
            and <strong>Bootstrap</strong> for styling. It includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A searchable database of players and matches.</li>
            <li>Filterable visualizations showing model performance.</li>
            <li>Machine learning pipelines implemented with
              <code>pyspark</code> and <code>scikit-learn</code> and <code>pandas</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This project was developed by <strong>Christopher McKenzie</strong>
            as part of his portfolio in Computer Science and Machine Learning.
